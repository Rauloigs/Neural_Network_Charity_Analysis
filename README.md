MORE BINNNING?
I didn't find it necesseraly to bin more Features due that all other features besides APPLICATION TYPE & CLASSIFICATION, had less than 10 values. Nevertheless the ASK_AMT (asked amount) has too many values and its density is concentrated in a small range. I also decided not to bin this, becuase I believe it to be one of the most important features for Alphabet Soup to take into account as a whole and there is no a tendency amount for this feature. 

DROP A COLUMN? 

I decided to drop SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS column because its a 2 values column where one value is 
N: 34272
Y: 27
