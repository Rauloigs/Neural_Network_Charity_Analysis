# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis


I didn't find it necesseraly to bin more Features due that all other features besides APPLICATION TYPE & CLASSIFICATION, had less than 10 values. Nevertheless the ASK_AMT (asked amount) has too many values and its density is concentrated in a small range. I also decided not to bin this, becuase I believe it to be one of the most important features for Alphabet Soup to take into account as a whole and there is no a tendency amount for this feature.
